        Shinnosuke Nohara (野原しんのすけ), also known as Shinchan or Shin, is the protagonist of Crayon Shin-chan. He is the
        son of
        Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is "Shin-chan" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy
        whose antics
        are the basis for the series.
        He is 5 years old and yet acts overtly mature. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no
        shame
        whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved
        the
        problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to
        that,
        he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo,
        fishing,
        skiing, swimming and others).

        He is often involved in a running gag of pulling down his pants to reveal his buttocks and dance in the process
        with an
        accompanying original song (known as "Ass dance" in the Funimation English dub). His affectionate name by
        relatives is
        Shin-chan. He is five years old and loves chocolate biscuits of the brand "Chocobi" and a TV superheronamed
        "Action
        Mask", but he dislikes green peppers. He always take care of his sister, Himawari. He inherited more genes from
        his
        mother than his father. He is lethargic, loves to eat and sleep, stingy, stubborn (a trait that passed down from
        his
        maternal grandfather to his 2 aunt and mother and his mother passed down to him), imagining things, cannot
        resist good
        things, opinionated and brazen which is just like his mother while the only thing same with his father is likes
        to watch
        and flirt pretty young ladies. Both Shin-chan and his sister's appearance look more like their mother. He is a
        very good
        singer and pretty good baseball and football player. He learned photography from his aunt Musae. He always takes
        care of
        his sister, Himawari. Sometimes he changes the actual words, making it very funny. For example, promise becomes
        promotion etc. He often exhibits deep affection for his best friend, Kazama. Some of his strange activities
        include
        dressing up (often as an animal). He also causes trouble for others and then criticizes their efforts in
        covering for
        him. In general, he is outspoken and very curious. He has little to no shame. In several occasions, both in
        manga and
        anime, he is either seen doing drag or wearing animal costumes. There have been several instances in which his
        antics
        actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at singing
        songs and
        changing their wordings. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness.
